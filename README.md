## R1 Description of web application 

### Purpose 

Our client is a local small business, named Bright Academics who specialises in providing tutoring services to individuals at all levels of their education journey, however, they have a definite focus on individuals who are sitting their HSC or equivalent. Due to an increase in both the number of tutors who are employed, as well as an increase in clients, Bright Academics is in need of a full fledged web application which provides usefulness to both clients and admins through the same web application. This web application will provide ease of use and allow for business processes for Bright Academics to be enhanced and improved. 

### Functionality / Features

Currently, at this point in time, this web application has three MVP's which will be included. These include; User Authenication which will allow for user registration and login as well as profile management including password recovery, Tutor Listing which will provide clients with tutor resumes, the subjects which they teach, pricing and filter functionality to allow for efficient searching based on price and subjects taught, and finally, there will be an admin dashboard where users with the correct permissions will be able to manage employment records. On top of these MVP's, there will be a a small amount of stretch goal features which may be present at final submission. A key strech goal for the project includes the implementation of an online booking system which will allow clients to view real time availability of tutors and allow for easy booking/cancellation of sessions.

### Target Audience

There are two key groups of individuals in which this web application will be appealing. This is of course the admin of Bright Academics who will be able to update tutor profiles on the application and manage employment records of tutors through the web application. Another key audience of this web application are prospective and current clients of Bright Academics who are interested in viewing the services/pricing which is offered. This will be a multi purpose app which is able to be utilised by both audiences, however the way they do so will be different in nature. 

### Tech Stack 

In order to complete this web application, we will be utilsiing the MERN stack. This includes; MongoDB, Express, React and Node.JS. A description of each will be discussed below: 

- MongoDB: A database management system which is considered to be a noSQL database. The data is stored in documents which further stored in collections. This will be uilised as the database for out web application.

- Express: Is a back-end web application which is utilised to create RESTful APIs inconjunction with Node.Js. It is lightweight and flexible in terms of its ability to route due to its use of middleware. Within this application, Express is being utilised to create the API.

- React: Is an extremely powerful JavaScript library which allows users to create dynamic and responsive front-ends for web applications. In our web application, it will be utilised to handle and maintain the front-end.

- Node.js: Is a cross platform, open source JavaScript runtime environment. It allows for and executes JavaScript code outside of the web broswer and in combination with Express, will be utilised to create and maintain the API.
