## R1 Description of web application 

### Purpose 

Our client is a local small business, named Bright Academics who specialises in providing tutoring services to individuals at all levels of their education journey, however, they have a definite focus on individuals who are sitting their HSC or equivalent. Due to an increase in both the number of tutors who are employed, as well as an increase in clients, Bright Academics is in need of a full fledged web application which provides usefulness to both clients and admins through the same web application. This web application will provide ease of use and allow for business processes for Bright Academics to be enhanced and improved. 

### Functionality / Features

Currently, at this point in time, this web application has three MVP's which will be included. These include; User Authenication which will allow for user registration and login as well as profile management including password recovery, Tutor Listing which will provide clients with tutor resumes, the subjects which they teach, pricing and filter functionality to allow for efficient searching based on price and subjects taught, and finally, there will be an admin dashboard where users with the correct permissions will be able to manage employment records. On top of these MVP's, there will be a a small amount of stretch goal features which may be present at final submission. A key strech goal for the project includes the implementation of an online booking system which will allow clients to view real time availability of tutors and allow for easy booking/cancellation of sessions.
